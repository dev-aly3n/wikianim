<p>Spoilers ahead.</p>

<p>
  First of all, we are extremely well introduced to it world. The first scene
  shows a huge Titan sticking out the wall, while the show explain to us what
  the humanity knows about the Titans, that is, particularly, not much. The only
  think we know about the humanity, is that they live in 3 different walls, and
  they have been in peace for hole century, but no one even know how the walls
  were built or even what had happened before.<br />\nAfter that scene, which
  don´t really know if it´s a moment from the past or future, we are teleported
  to our 2 of the 3 main characters, Eren and Mikasa. Later on, they will get to
  Armin, the third one.

  Inside the walls, people don´t even think about Titans and the Garrison
  Regiment, one of the military force who “patrols” the city, don´t take their
  job seriously.<br />\nEverything looks very peaceful but it´s nothing but a
  distorted peace of what´s the world like. The only one who really know the
  horrible true of the terrifying world they live in, is the Survey Corps. The
  second military force, the ones who explore beyond the walls and the ones Eren
  is very excited about.<br />\nJust to mention, the third force is the Military
  Police Regiment, who patrol the city inside the third and most protected city
  inside the walls.

  As I mentioned before, things aren´t as beautiful as they seem. Suddenly, a 60
  meters Titan appears and creates a big hole in the wall, letting others titans
  get through. We went from peace, to chaos, the citizen evacuating the city and
  much of them dying. Since the first episode we see the reality, titans
  destroying the city and eating as many humans they can see, and even the force
  it´s completely in shock. The show shows how terrifying Titans are by the
  first minutes when one of them grabs Eren´s mother and break her in the middle
  to scarf her. All that in front of his eyes. That is a very important break
  down point on our charecter personality, which increase his feeling of knowing
  the exterior world and generate, consumed by anger, the need for exterminate
  every single titan. The city evacuated to Wall Rose.

  By far, a very chaotic and stressful beginning, but, does the series calms
  down on its narrative? No. The following episodes we get introduced very
  interesting new characters, while they train to become soldiers, the tension
  between some of them and they progress.<br />\nEren, by his speech of how the
  weak cannot became soldiers, influences most of his partners to enter the
  Survey Corps, the most dangerous one, after 5 years of training. When just
  after they had graduated, the Colossal Titan appears again. The situation is
  the same as before, chaos and panic in all the city and the soldiers. This
  causes many deaths of characters we got to know a bit, Even Eren seems to die,
  but, did him?

  Suddenly, appears a titan who fight against other titans. Between agony and
  doubts, Eren Jaeger comes out from that titan. Now we have more questions. Can
  humans transform into titans?<br />\nThe series continues by and Eren, using
  his powers, could took a rock and sail the hole in the wall, with some
  troubles in within.<br />\nThe rest of the show is pretty much that, our
  characters join into excursions with the force, we know new important
  characters and discover new &quot;smart titans&quot; that are within the
  humanity.

<center>__Characters:__</center>
\n
<p>
  Eren Jaeger: He is not an exceptional protagonist, but it´s great because of
  that. He entered the Survey Corps because it was his dream and to take revenge
  for his mother. He is a 15 year old kid who doesn´t really know the world, he
  doesn´t know if he can even trust himself or their partners. Is a very
  realistic teen character in a wicked world.
</p>
\n
<p>
  Mikasa Ackerman: I really like Mikasa on this season. She was the best soldier
  during the military train and we definitely see her show off. She got adopted
  by Eren´s family, so is very close to Eren, which I personally don´t like
  about her. In the first season it´s okay, but longer, she is VERY worried
  about everything that has to do with Eren.
</p>
\n
<p>
  Armin Arlert: A bullied kid who always get help from Mikasa and Eren. He lost
  his entire family and wants to achieve his grandpa´s goal, go to the outside,
  discover the world. Armin is an excellent character, he starts being very
  fearful and nervous on every situation, but as long as the events happen, he
  takes a step forward and manage the situation without much confidence on
  himself.

<p>
  What can I say, the visuals are just excellent and the music ambient the
  scenes very well, it has the tone the show need.

  This is my very first written review of something, so of course it´s not a
  good one but I will try to do it better.
